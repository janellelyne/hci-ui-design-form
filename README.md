Project Scope

Since this is a course in user interface design, your assignment is to write a simple program to maintain a file of data.  This is a very common thing to write in the “real world,” but it’s not as easy as it looks.  Consider a company that has a department that processes rebates*.  The buyer of a particular product sends in a form with various information and a clerk enters it into a program to be stored in a database.  (This model is changing.  Companies are now getting users to do some of the data entry by using a Web site.)  Rebates are available only to people living in the United States.  Your job is to write that program.   This is a “sovereign app,” so design it as such.
